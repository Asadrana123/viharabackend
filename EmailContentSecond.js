           <p>Hi ${user?.["First Name"] || "Valued Partner"},</p>
           <p>Quick thought: What if the <strong>highest-intent buyers</strong>â€”the ones who close fastâ€”never saw your listings?</p>
           <ul>
             <li>Most auction platforms market to the <em>usual buyers.</em></li>
             <li>Vihara connects sellers to <strong>private buyer pools</strong> that aren't visible on other sites.</li>
             <li>It's not about more eyesâ€”it's about <strong>the right eyes</strong></li>
           </ul>
           <p>Curious? I'll show you how.</p>

           <p>Hi ${user?.["First Name"] || "Valued Partner"},</p>
           <p>Most sellers think "more traffic = better outcome." We've found the opposite:</p>
           <ul>
             <li>Traditional platforms chase volumeâ€”we track <strong>engagement depth</strong></li>
             <li>Our buyer network includes <strong>off-market investors</strong>, trust funds, and fix-and-hold firms you won't see on the public grid</li>
             <li>We bring them in <em>before</em> auction dayâ€”<strong>quietly.</strong></li>
           </ul>
           <p>We don't compete with the crowd. We skip it.</p>
           <p>Want to see what that changes?</p>

           <p>Hi ${user?.["First Name"] || "Valued Partner"},</p>
           <p>Sellers tell us the same thing:</p>
           <p>"We had 12 bidders. 1 closed."</p>
           <p>We get it. So we built Vihara differently:</p>
           <ul>
             <li>Our buyer intake process <strong>qualifies intent</strong> with behavioral and financial signals</li>
             <li>That means <strong>fewer bids, more closings</strong></li>
             <li>It's not about flashy listingsâ€”it's about <strong>quiet confidence in the outcome</strong></li>
           </ul>
           <p>Less noise. More certainty.</p>
           <p>Want a walkthrough?</p>

           <p>Hi ${user?.["First Name"] || "Valued Partner"},</p>
           <p>REO shouldn't feel like roulette. At Vihara:</p>
           <ul>
             <li>We treat auctions like <strong>matchmaking</strong>, not marketing</li>
             <li>The right buyers show up <em>before</em> auction dayâ€”and stay through closing</li>
             <li>No surprises, no re-listing, no endless back-and-forth</li>
           </ul>
           <p>I'd love to show you how we do it.</p>

           <p>Hi ${user?.["First Name"] || "Valued Partner"},</p>
           <p>One of our clients recently said:</p>
           <p>"With Vihara, it just <em>felt</em> different. No games, no ghostingâ€”just the right buyers, ready."</p>
           <p>Here's what made the difference:</p>
           <ul>
             <li>Vihara doesn't chase mass traffic. We <strong>cultivate readiness</strong></li>
             <li>Our buyer signals go beyond clicksâ€”we look at <strong>intent, history, and capability</strong></li>
             <li>Sellers stay in control because <strong>we control for buyer noise</strong></li>
           </ul>
           <p>Would you want to pilot one listing?</p>

    body:

           <p>Hi ${user?.["First Name"] || "Valued Partner"},</p>
           <p>If REO sales feel unpredictableâ€” It's likely a <strong>buyer problem</strong>, not a seller one.</p>
           <p>Vihara fixes that with:</p>
           <ul>
             <li>A <strong>pre-qualified pool</strong> that behaves more like direct buyers than opportunists</li>
             <li>Zero listing fees unless we win for you</li>
             <li>A process that's simple, not loud</li>
           </ul>
           <p>One test listing. One clean close.</p>

           <p>Hi ${user?.["First Name"] || "Valued Partner"},</p>
           <p>Better is debatable. Different is undeniable.</p>
           <ul>
             <li>Vihara doesn't list. We <em>target.</em></li>
             <li>Our buyers don't browse. They <em>buy.</em></li>
             <li>And our sellers? They sleep better.</li>
           </ul>
           <p>Let's try one together. Just one asset. One test. That's it.</p>
