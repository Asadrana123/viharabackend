        body: `<p>Dear ${user?.["First Name"] || "Valued Partner"},</p>

        <p>I hope this email finds you well! I wanted to share three key insights about the current distressed property market that could benefit your institution’s asset management strategy:</p>

        <h3>🔹 Increased Default Rates</h3>
        <p>As the economic climate remains uncertain, default rates are rising, meaning more distressed properties are entering the market, creating a need for efficient liquidation strategies.</p>

        <h3>🔹 Higher Recovery Values Through Auctions</h3>
        <p>Studies show that auctioning distressed properties can yield higher recovery rates compared to traditional sales methods, making it a lucrative option for banks and credit unions looking to maximize asset recovery.</p>

        <h3>🔹 Regulatory Pressure on Property Disposal</h3>
        <p>Regulatory requirements for holding non-performing loans and properties are tightening. Auctioning distressed assets provides a compliant and timely solution to avoid penalties and costly delays.</p>

        <p>I'd love to connect and explore how Vihara can help you effectively manage and liquidate distressed properties.</p>

        <p>Thanks,</p>

        <p>I wanted to share a few unexpected but important facts about the distressed property market that could make a real difference for your institution:</p>

        <h3>🏦 Foreclosures Can Be Profitable</h3>
        <p>Believe it or not, banks that auction distressed properties can sometimes recover more than they’d expect—especially when the bidding gets competitive! It’s not just about moving assets; it’s about getting top dollar.</p>

        <h3>📈 Investor Interest is Through the Roof</h3>
        <p>The market is flooded with eager investors looking for foreclosure and distressed properties. Auctioning these assets creates a vibrant, competitive environment that drives higher bids—and faster sales.</p>

        <h3>⏳ Properties Can Sell in a Day</h3>
        <p>One of the biggest perks of auctioning distressed real estate is the speed. Some properties are sold in a matter of hours, freeing up capital and reducing your holding costs.</p>

        <p>I wanted to share a few surprising insights about distressed property auctions that could help your institution navigate and profit from the market more effectively:</p>
      
        <h3>💰 Holding Costs Add Up Fast</h3>
        <p>Every unsold distressed property ties up capital and increases maintenance, insurance, and tax expenses. The quicker you sell, the more you save.</p>
      
        <h3>📊 Auctions Drive Higher Returns</h3>
        <p>Competitive bidding creates urgency and can often push final sale prices beyond expectations, maximizing your recovery.</p>
      
        <h3>⏳ Traditional Sales Take Too Long</h3>
        <p>Standard real estate sales can drag on for months, but auctions can move properties in days—sometimes even hours.</p>

        <p>Hi ${user?.["First Name"] || "Valued Partner"},</p>
    
        <p>I wanted to share a few fresh insights about the distressed property market that could be valuable for your institution:</p>
    
        <ul>
          <li><b>Rising Interest Rates Are Creating More Defaults</b> – As borrowing costs increase, more homeowners are struggling with mortgage payments, leading to a growing inventory of distressed properties. This presents both challenges and opportunities for banks.</li>
          <li><b>Direct Sales Often Undervalue Assets</b> – Traditional methods like direct sales or bulk REO transactions often result in lower recovery rates. Auctions bring in a competitive buyer pool, ensuring properties sell closer to their actual value.</li>
          <li><b>The Average Foreclosure Takes Over 900 Days</b> – Holding onto distressed properties for too long increases legal, tax, and maintenance costs. Accelerating the sale process through auctions helps free up capital and reduce long-term liabilities.</li>
        </ul>
